A comprehensive implementation of deep learning algorithms using only NumPy. This repository is designed for those who want to understand the inner workings of neural networks without the abstraction of deep learning frameworks.

## üéØ Motivation

Understanding deep learning at a fundamental level is crucial for:
- Building intuition about how neural networks actually work
- Developing custom implementations for specific use cases
- Debugging complex models with confidence
- Appreciating the elegance of modern deep learning frameworks

This repository strips away all abstractions and implements neural networks from their mathematical foundations, using only NumPy.
