# üß† Deep Learning from Scratch

A comprehensive implementation of deep learning algorithms using only NumPy. This repository is designed for those who want to understand the inner workings of neural networks without the abstraction of deep learning frameworks.

## üéØ Motivation

Understanding deep learning at a fundamental level is crucial for:
- Building intuition about how neural networks actually work
- Developing custom implementations for specific use cases
- Debugging complex models with confidence
- Appreciating the elegance of modern deep learning frameworks

This repository strips away all abstractions and implements neural networks from their mathematical foundations, using only NumPy.

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized to follow the natural progression of deep learning concepts:

1. **Foundations**
   - Perceptron
   - Activation Functions
   - Loss Functions

2. **Optimization**
   - Gradient Descent
   - Backpropagation

3. **Neural Networks**
   - Multilayer Perceptron
   - Forward and Backward Propagation

4. **Advanced Topics**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Recurrent Neural Networks
   - Regularization Techniques
   - Optimization Algorithms

Each module contains:
- A detailed explanation of the concept with mathematical formulations
- A clean, well-documented implementation in Python using NumPy
- Examples demonstrating the use of the implementation
- Visualizations to build intuition

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the examples)
